# Ask Me Anything üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ask Me Anything is a tool built with Streamlit, allowing users to ask questions about the content of PDF or CSV files. Users can upload a file, process it, and ask questions about the content. The answers are generated using an OpenAI-based model.

## Features

- File upload: Accepts PDF and CSV files.
- File processing: Extracts text from PDF files and transforms it into a query-able format. CSV processing is in the to-do list.
- Text chunking: Splits text into chunks for efficient processing.
- Text embeddings: Transforms text into OpenAI embeddings.
- Question answering: Answers user queries using a trained OpenAI model.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The project requires Python 3.7 or later, and the following Python libraries:

- streamlit
- numpy
- pandas
- python-dotenv
- PyPDF2
- langchain (including the required modules)
- OpenAI
- FAISS
- pickle
- os
- tempfile

You can install the dependencies with:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

Note: This project uses the OpenAI API for text embeddings and question answering, so you will need an API key. You can obtain a key by signing up on the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/).

### Running the App
First, clone the repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ask-me-anything.git
cd ask-me-anything
\`\`\`

Then, run the Streamlit app:

\`\`\`bash
streamlit run main.py
\`\`\`

This will open a web browser window. You can upload a file, process it, and start asking questions about the content!

### Usage

- Click "Browse files" to upload a PDF or CSV file.
- Click "Process and Store as Pickle" to process the file and store it in a pickle format.
- Ask questions about the content of the file in the "Ask me a question" text field.
